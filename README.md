# FizzBuzz+
![stolen from google](https://code.kx.com/q/img/fizzbuzz.png)

Have you been asked for doing FizzBuzz during interview?

well, not for me
cause i am still a student lol

Anyway, `FizzBuzz+` is a language where its only function is to do FizzBuzz!

not very exciting, right? yea this is just a bad joke ending up wasting 15 mins of my life lol

## How to use

```
15:FizzBuzz!
5:Buzz!
3:Fizz!
```
this will be your regular FizzBuzz program, formed by 3 `conditions`, which is just saying :
```
if mod 15 has no remainder, print "FizzBuzz!"
if mod 5 has no remainder, print "Buzz!"
if mod 3 has no remainder, print "Fizz!"
```
a condition can be seen as
```
n:p
// if current value mod {n}, remainder = 0, print {p}
n|r:p
// if current value mod {n}, remainder = {r}, print {p}
n:p$x$
// if current value mod {n}, remainder = 0, print {p}, maximum of {x} times
n|r:p$x$
// if current value mod {n}, remainder = {r}, print {p}, maximum of {x} times
```
for instance, `15:FizzBuzz!` means *mod 15 has no remainder, print "FizzBuzz!"* and `7|2:Monkey!`  means *mod 7, remainder equals 2, print "Monkey!"*


*\*note that "FizzBuzz!" will override "Buzz!" and "Fizz!" as it is in higher position*

here is a few thing i implemented :

`~` can be used to represent current value

`^` can be used to represent the max value

`&` can connect the expression part and the string part



## Explanation for example

here are few example i written in `FizzBuzz+`

### [Hello, World!](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Hello,_world!)
```
1:Hello, World!
```

### [Truth-machine](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Truth-machine)
```
1:1
```
*\*just put in a large number and pretend it is infinite*

### Even number (Usage of $)
```
4:I am a even number larger than 2!
2:I am 2!$1$
4|2:I am a even number larger than 2!
```

### Double Up (Usage of ~)
```
1:~+~
```

### End (Usage of ^)
```
^:this is the end of the program, bye bye!
```

### [99 bottles of beer](https://esolangs.org/wiki/99_bottles_of_beer)
```
^:1 bottle of beer on the wall,\n1 bottle of beer.\nTake one down, pass it around,\nNo bottle of beer on the wall.
1:(^-~)& bottles of beer on the wall,\n&(^-~)& bottle of beer.\nTake one down, pass it around,\n&(^-~)& bottles of beer on the wall.
```
