# FizzBuzz+
![stolen from google](https://code.kx.com/q/img/fizzbuzz.png)

Have you been asked for doing FizzBuzz during interview?

well, not for me
cause i am still a student lol

Anyway, `FizzBuzz+` is a language where its only function is to do FizzBuzz!

not very exciting, right? yea this is just a bad joke ending up wasting 15 mins of my life lol

## How to use

```
15:FizzBuzz!
5:Buzz!
3:Fizz!
```
this will be your regular FizzBuzz program
which is just saying
```
if mod 15 has no remainder, print "FizzBuzz!"
if mod 5 has no remainder, print "Buzz!"
if mod 3 has no remainder, print "Fizz!"
```
note that "FizzBuzz!" will override "Buzz!" and "Fizz!" as it is in higher position

also
`~` can be used to represent current value
and
`^` can be used to represent the max value

thats all that it got. have fun!
